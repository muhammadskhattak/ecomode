                        We are a project that advocates for sustainable lifestyles. Limiting our hyper-consumerist economy to Earthâ€™s finite resources,
                        we encourage consumers to engage in minimalist lifestyles, slow fashion and slow architecture by purchasing from student designers, 
                        creators, and artists. We are looking to upcycle second hand clothing, textiles and everyday waste, giving them a new life in fashion, 
                        art, and architecture.
